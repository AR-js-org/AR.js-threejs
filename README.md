# AR.js-threejs

Testing repository for the AR.js core module. I'm converting AR.js code to the Typescript langauge but providing the same classes and structures as much as possible.

## Examples
For now, you can find one **example** in vanilla JS and another one in Typescript in the **example-ts** folder. More examples will be added in a near future.
