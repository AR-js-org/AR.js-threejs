# AR.js-threejs

Testing repository for the AR.js core module. I'm converting AR.js code to the Typescript language but providing the same classes and structures as much as possible.
The module export two namespaces as in the old implementation: **THREEx** and **ARjs**.

## List of classes in the namespaces
### THREEx:
- [x] ArBaseControls
- [x] ArClickability
- [x] ArMarkerCloak
- [x] ArMarkerHelper
- [x] ArMarkerControls
- [x] ArSmoothedControls
- [x] ArToolkitContext
- [x] ArToolkitSource
- [x] ArToolkitProfile
- [x] ArVideoinwebgl
- [x] HittestingPlane

### ARjs:

- [x] Source
- [x] Context
- [x] Profile
- [x] Utils

## Examples
For now, you can find two vanilla JS examples in the **examples** folder and another one in Typescript in the **example-ts** folder. More examples will be added in a near future.
